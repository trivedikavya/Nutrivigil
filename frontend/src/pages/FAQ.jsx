                answer: "NutriVigil is an AI-powered nutrition analysis platform that helps you understand the nutritional content of your food. Simply upload an image of your meal, and our advanced AI technology will analyze it and provide detailed nutritional information tailored to your health conditions."

                question: "How does NutriVigil work?",
                answer: "NutriVigil uses Google Gemini AI for food recognition and analysis. When you upload a food image, our AI identifies the food items, estimates portions, calculates nutritional values, and provides personalized recommendations based on your health profile. We also integrate with API Ninjas for comprehensive nutritional data."
            },
            {
                question: "Is NutriVigil free to use?",

            },
            {
                question: "Do I need to create an account?",
                answer: "No account is required for basic food analysis. However, creating a profile allows you to save your health conditions, track your food history, and get personalized recommendations."

        scanner: [
            {
                question: "How do I upload images for analysis?",
                answer: "Click on the 'Scan Food' button on the homepage, then either drag and drop your food image or click to browse your files. You can upload images in JPG, PNG, or WEBP format up to 10MB."

            {
                question: "What types of food can I scan?",
                answer: "You can scan almost any food! Our AI recognizes fruits, vegetables, cooked meals, packaged foods, beverages, snacks, and more. For best results, ensure the food is clearly visible and well-lit in the image."
            },
            {
                question: "How accurate is the nutritional analysis?",
                answer: "Our AI provides highly accurate results, typically within 10-15% of actual values. However, accuracy depends on image quality, lighting, and portion visibility. For critical dietary needs, we recommend consulting with a healthcare professional."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I scan multiple food items at once?",

            {
                question: "What if the AI doesn't recognize my food?",
                answer: "If the AI has trouble identifying your food, try taking a clearer photo with better lighting. You can also try different angles or separating mixed items. Our system is constantly learning and improving!"

            {
                question: "Why is my analysis taking so long?",
                answer: "Analysis typically takes 3-10 seconds. Longer times may occur due to large image sizes, complex meals with many items, or high server load. If it takes more than 30 seconds, try refreshing and uploading again."
